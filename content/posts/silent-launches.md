In 2020, I worked at a company that offered a digital wallet service, used by over 3 million users. During my time there, my team and I spent months developing a feature eagerly anticipated by our users. When we finally launched it, our tech infrastructure couldn't handle the sudden surge in traffic, and everything collapsed.

We learned a lesson the hard way: **"New features have to be released gradually"**.

In this article, I'll break down different strategies of what's called **Gradual Rollouts**, which we used for the following features we launched. This is a phased approach in engineering for releasing updates that enables testing stability and performance with a limited audience, identifying issues with minimal overall user impact.

### Dark Launching

Dark Launching is a backend technique that involves introducing a new feature, which is then released to current users without their knowledge. This technique provides insights into how the feature would behave in production without actually impacting users.

In the dark launching process, we modify our systems to run the new feature in the background, without showing any changes to users. This involves executing all its functions, data processing and system interactions silently. 

Meanwhile, this allows test engineers to evaluate the new feature performance in a real-world setting without impacting the user experience.

This process allows for performance testing, issue detection, infrastructure scaling assessments and stress testing under actual traffic conditions while keeping it hidden from users.

Dark launching is particularly effective for critical updates where precision is crucial and risks are high. Its strength lies in testing features discreetly, maintaining user experience while identifying potential issues early. However, it requires significant backend effort and may not capture real user reactions or feedback, as users are unaware of the changes being tested.

### Canary Release

Canary Release is a method used to minimize the risk of deploying new versions by initially introducing the update to a small group of users. This approach involves gradually extending the update across the entire system.

This technique starts with the new version being deployed to a part of the infrastructure not yet accessed by users, and then the process continues by gradually routing some user traffic to the  new version.

<p style="margin-top: 35px;"></p>

The term is derived from an [old mining practice](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/story-real-canary-coal-mine-180961570/), where miners took canaries into mines as an early warning system against toxic gases. Just as the canary would alert miners to danger, a canary release detects potential issues in a software update before it affects all users.

In modern distributed systems, instead of using a router for this process, various strategies are employed. These include rolling out updates to specific geographic regions first or to specific user groups based on criteria like user behavior, device type, or membership tier.

Canary Release is particularly effective for applications requiring extensive user feedback where minimizing risk is crucial. The major advantage lies in its ability to detect issues early with minimal user impact. However, it demands meticulous monitoring and can lead to a slower overall release process.

The concepts of **Dark Launching** and **Canary Release** have evolved over time, leading to some confusion. Nowadays, they are often used interchangeably, but it's important to note that they are not the same.

Alongside the mentioned strategies, **Feature Toggles** are essential in implementing Canary Releases. They enable the introduction of new features within the same production environment. This approach allows for incremental rollouts to these specific user groups, streamlining the release process and reducing the need for maintaining multiple environments.

### Shadow Testing

Shadow testing is a technique used to compare the current environment with a new one that includes a new feature. Its purpose is to identify and reduce potential risks before releasing the new feature to users, all without users ever knowing it's happening.

In shadow testing, we observe how real users interact with our system by examining their actual traffic, all without impacting the code or the experience of users in the production environment.

<p style="margin-top: 30px;"></p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px;"></p>

A replica of the production environment is created to mimic real user traffic. This environment serves as a _shadow_ of the production environment. The new feature is then tested in a different environment. After testing, the responses from both environments are compared by test engineers to identify any risks before introducing the new feature to the production environment.

This technique is particularly convenient in scenarios where accurate performance assessment under real-world conditions is essential, without the risk of disrupting user experience. Itâ€™s ideal for systems that handle sensitive data or complex transactions, where unnoticed errors could lead to significant issues. 

The primary advantage of Shadow Testing is its ability to provide a realistic evaluation of new features, without affecting end users. However, it can be resource-intensive to set up and maintain a parallel environment, and it may not fully capture user experience aspects, since interactions are only simulated, not directly observed.

### TL;DR

| Gradual&nbsp;Rollout&nbsp;Strategy | Description |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- |
| **Dark Launching**              | Deploying a feature in production without making it visible to users. The functionality is _dark_ to users, but can be selectively enabled for testing purposes. |
| **Canary Release**              | Rolling out a new feature incrementally to a small subset of users before a full deployment, often implemented through the use of **Feature Toggles**.    |
| **Shadow Testing**              | Duplicating real traffic to a parallel new service version, which processes it without affecting or being noticed by users, allowing performance and stability testing under real conditions. |
